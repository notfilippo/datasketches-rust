This is the core Rust component of the DataSketches library.  It contains a subset of the sketching algorithms and can be accessed directly from user applications.

Note that we have parallel core library components for Java, C++, Python, and Go implementations of many of the same sketch algorithms:

- [datasketches-java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java)
- [datasketches-cpp](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp)
- [datasketches-python](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-python)
- [datasketches-go](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-go)

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information.

If you are interested in making contributions to this site, please see our [Community](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/Community/) page for how to contact us.
