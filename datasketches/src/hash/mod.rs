/// The seed 9001 used in the sketch update methods is a prime number that was chosen very early
/// on in experimental testing.
///
/// Choosing a seed is somewhat arbitrary, and the author cannot prove that this particular seed
/// is somehow superior to other seeds. There was some early Internet discussion that a seed of 0
/// did not produce as clean avalanche diagrams as non-zero seeds, but this may have been more
/// related to the MurmurHash2 release, which did have some issues. As far as the author can
/// determine, MurmurHash3 does not have these problems.
///
/// In order to perform set operations on two sketches it is critical that the same hash function
/// and seed are identical for both sketches, otherwise the assumed 1:1 relationship between the
/// original source key value and the hashed bit string would be violated. Once you have developed
/// a history of stored sketches you are stuck with it.
