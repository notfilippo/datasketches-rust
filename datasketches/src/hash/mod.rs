/// is somehow superior to other seeds. There was some early Internet discussion that a seed of 0
/// did not produce as clean avalanche diagrams as non-zero seeds, but this may have been more
/// related to the MurmurHash2 release, which did have some issues. As far as the author can
/// determine, MurmurHash3 does not have these problems.
