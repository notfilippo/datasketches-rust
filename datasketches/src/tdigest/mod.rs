//! T-Digest implementation for estimating quantiles and ranks.
//!
//! The implementation in this library is based on the MergingDigest described in
//! [Computing Extremely Accurate Quantiles Using t-Digests][paper] by Ted Dunning and Otmar Ertl.
//!
//! The implementation in this library has a few differences from the reference implementation
//! associated with that paper:
//!
//! * Merge does not modify the input
//! * Deserialization similar to other sketches in this library, although reading the reference
//!   implementation format is supported
//!
//! Unlike all other algorithms in the library, t-digest is empirical and has no mathematical
//! basis for estimating its error and its results are dependent on the input data. However,
//! for many common data distributions, it can produce excellent results. t-digest also operates
//! only on numeric data and, unlike the quantiles family algorithms in the library which return
//! quantile approximations from the input domain, t-digest interpolates values and will hold and
//! return data points not seen in the input.
//!
//! The closest alternative to t-digest in this library is REQ sketch. It prioritizes one chosen
//! side of the rank domain: either low rank accuracy or high rank accuracy. t-digest (in this
//! implementation) prioritizes both ends of the rank domain and has lower accuracy towards the
//! middle of the rank domain (median).
//!
//! Measurements show that t-digest is slightly biased (tends to underestimate low ranks and
//! overestimate high ranks), while still doing very well close to the extremes. The effect seems
//! to be more pronounced with more input values.
//!
//! For more information on the performance characteristics, see the
//! [Datasketches page on t-digest](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/tdigest/tdigest.html).
