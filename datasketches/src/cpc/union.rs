//! The merging logic is somewhat involved, so it will be summarized here.
//!
//! First, we compare the K values of the union and the source sketch.
//!
//! If `source.K < union.K`, we reduce the union's K to match, which requires downsampling the
//! union's internal sketch.
//!
//! Here is how to perform the downsampling:
//!
//! If the union contains a bitMatrix, downsample it by row-wise ORing.
//!
//! If the union contains a sparse sketch, then create a new empty sketch, and walk the old target
//! sketch updating the new one (with modulo). At the end, check whether the new target sketch is
//! still in sparse mode (it might not be, because downsampling densifies the set of collected
//! coupons). If it is NOT in sparse mode, immediately convert it to a bitMatrix.
//!
//! At this point, we have `source.K >= union.K`. (We won't keep mentioning this, but in all the
//! following the source's row indices are used mod union.K while updating the union's sketch.
//! That takes care of the situation where `source.K < union.K`.)
//!
//! Case A: union is Sparse and source is Sparse. We walk the source sketch updating the union's
//! sketch. At the end, if the union's sketch is no longer in sparse mode, we convert it to a
//! bitMatrix.
//!
//! Case B: union is bitMatrix and source is Sparse. We walk the source sketch, setting bits in the
//! bitMatrix.
//!
//! In the remaining cases, we have flavor(source) > Sparse, so we immediately convert the union's
//! sketch to a bitMatrix (even if the union contains very few coupons). Then:
//!
//! Case C: union is bitMatrix and source is Hybrid or Pinned. Then we OR the source's sliding
//! window into the bitMatrix, and walk the source's table, setting bits in the bitMatrix.
//!
//! Case D: union is bitMatrix, and source is Sliding. Then we convert the source into a bitMatrix,
//! and OR it into the union's bitMatrix. (Important note; merely walking the source wouldn't work
//! because of the partially inverted Logic in the Sliding flavor, where the presence of coupons
//! is sometimes indicated by the ABSENCE of row_col pairs in the surprises table.)
//!
//! How does [`CpcUnion::to_sketch`] work?
//!
//! If the union has an Accumulator state, make a copy of that sketch.
//!
//! If the union has a BitMatrix state, then we have to convert the bitMatrix back into a sketch,
//! which requires doing some extra work to figure out the values of num_coupons, offset,
//! first_interesting_column, and kxp.
