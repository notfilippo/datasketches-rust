//! Compressed Probabilistic Counting sketch.
//!
//! This is a unique-counting sketch that implements the Compressed Probabilistic Counting (CPC,
//! a.k.a. FM85) algorithms developed by Kevin Lang in his paper [Back to the Future: an Even More
//! Nearly Optimal Cardinality Estimation Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06839).
//!
//! This sketch is extremely space-efficient when serialized. In an apples-to-apples empirical
//! comparison against compressed HyperLogLog sketches, this new algorithm simultaneously wins on
//! the two dimensions of the space/accuracy tradeoff and produces sketches that are smaller than
//! the entropy of HLL, so no possible implementation of compressed HLL can match its space
//! efficiency for a given accuracy. As described in the paper this sketch implements a newly
//! developed ICON estimator algorithm that survives union operations, another well-known estimator,
//! the [Historical Inverse Probability (HIP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3284) estimator does not.
//!
//! The update speed performance of this sketch is quite fast and is comparable to the speed of HLL.
//! The union (merging) capability of this sketch also allows for merging of sketches with different
//! configurations of K.
//!
//! For additional security this sketch can be configured with a user-specified hash seed.
